Abstract:
    In the time of large space surveys that provide tremendous amounts of
    precise data, it is highly desirable to have a commonly accepted
    methodology and system for the classification of variable stars. This
    is especially important for A-F stars, which can show intrinsic
    brightness variations due to both rotation and pulsations.

    The goal of our study is to provide a reliable classification of the
    variability of A-F stars brighter than 11 mag located in the northern
    TESS continuous viewing zone. We also aim to provide a thorough
    discussion about issues in the classification related to data
    characteristics and the issues arising from the similar light-curve
    shape generated by different physical mechanisms.

    We used TESS long- and short-cadence photometric data and
    corresponding Fourier transform to classify the variability type of
    the stars. We also used spectroscopic observations to determine the
    projected rotational velocity of a few stars.

    We present a clear and concise classification system that is
    demonstrated on many examples. We find clear signs of variability in
    3025 of 5923 studied stars (51%). For 1813 of these 3025 stars, we
    provide a classification; the rest cannot be unambiguously classified.
    Of the classified stars, 64.5% are pulsating stars of g-mode {gamma}
    Doradus (GDOR) and p-mode {delta} Scuti types and their hybrids. We
    realised that the long- and short-cadence pre-search data conditioning
    simple aperture photometry data can differ significantly not only in
    amplitude but also in the content of instrumental and data-reduction
    artefacts, making the long-cadence data less reliable. We identified a
    new group of stars that show stable light curves and characteristic
    frequency spectrum patterns (8.5% of the classified stars). According
    to the position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, these stars are
    likely GDOR stars but are on average about 200K cooler than GDORs and
    have smaller amplitudes and longer periods. With the help of
    spectroscopic measurements of vsini, we show that the variability of
    stars with unresolved groups of peaks located close to the positions
    of the harmonics in their frequency spectra (16% of the classified
    stars) can be caused by rotation rather than by pulsations. We show
    that without spectroscopic observations it can be impossible to
    unambiguously distinguish between ellipsoidal variability and
    rotational variability. We also applied our methodology to three
    previous studies and find significant discrepancies in the
    classification.

Description:
    We present a classification of A-F spectral type stars brighter than
    11 mag that are located in the TESS continuous viewing zone. We found
    clear signs of variability in 3025 of 5923 studied stars (51%). For
    1813 of these 3025 stars, we provide a classification. From the
    classified stars, 64.5% are pulsating stars of GDOR and DSCT types
    and their hybrids. We identified a new group of stars showing stable
    light curves and characteristic frequency spectra pattern (8.5% of
    the classified stars).

    The classification is based on the light-curve shape and Fourier
    transform of photometric data. We used TESS SPOC and QLP data
    products. For ech star we give identification in the TIC catalogue,
    equatorial coordinates, variability type, spectral type based on
    LAMOST spectra, dominant frequency value, zero epoch (for eclipsing
    binaries), amplitude of the photometric variations in TESS filter, VSX
    designation, VSX variability type, information about blending stars,
    and number of stars that are closer than 5 pixels having brightness
    difference less than 5mag.
