TESSellator is a code for using TESS files for classification via machine learning.

Arraymaker is designed to be run from the DATA directory and calls on the scripts in the subdirectories to obtain the data using LightKurve.

It then generates arrays of the data, for use in a CNN machine learning process (not yet created).
The lightcurve data is also saved in DATA/FITS/ for use later.
