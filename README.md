TESSelator is a program for obtaining TESS files, converting them into
lightcurves, and plotting them.

Work will start on initially being able to plot and work with TESS lightcurves.
Then, the end goal is for it to be able to use TESS Full Frame Images (FFI)
and convert them into useable lightcurves for each star present.

This will probably require aperture photometry, as well as use of Astroquery and
Lightkurve libraries.
